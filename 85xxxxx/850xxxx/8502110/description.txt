First I converted the source from Retail to VL because you are
NEVER going to activate any Retail version without purchasing.
There would obviously be small periods where leaked keys could
be used to retail activate, but it would only work for a short
while before MS blocks the key. This is why we use VL for KMS
activation.

Then I added all the big MSP files into the updates folder.
You can't simply toss the exe files from MS Download Center in the
folder, but you can extract those files with 7-zip and then copy the
en-US and the none.MSP files to there. You also have to add any
proofing Spanish and French files or Update nags you.

And that's exactly what I've done. These are all of the MSP files
contained in MOST of the KB exe files available for download. There
are still a few ones that don't have any MSP file inside, but
they are very small. The non-MSP kb files total about 1-2megs on
Microsoft Download. Those, you can do yourself. I cannot
pre-integrate those without making a fully custom install using
a bunch of registry settings, task settings, services, etc.
Basically, just not gonna happen; would be a mistake to even try.

MSP files added to Updates Folder:
access-x-none.msp, ace-x-none.msp, convintl-en-us.msp, csi-x-none.msp,
excel-x-none.msp, excelintl-en-us.msp, groove-x-none.msp, grooveintl-en-us.msp,
lync-x-none.msp, lyncintl-en-us.msp, msmipc-x-none.msp, mso-x-none.msp,
msointl-en-us.msp, msores-x-none.msp, oart-x-none.msp, oleo-x-none.msp,
onenote-x-none.msp, osetup-x-none.msp, outlfltr-x-none.msp, outlook-x-none.msp,
outlookintl-en-us.msp, powerpoint-x-none.msp, powerpointintl-en-us.msp,
project-x-none.msp, proof-en-us.msp, proof-es-es.msp,
visio-x-none.msp, visiointl-en-us.msp, vviewer-x-none.msp, word-x-none.msp

If you are contemplating using this for a different language, I'd
recommend using the MSDN iso from that language, and going through the
exe extraction process like I have. It's not difficult. You just keep
extracting and adding them to the updates folder until Microsoft Update
stops nagging you. Adding another language pack would probably be fairly
simple, but I have no experience with that. You would need to search web.

You can activate using MS Toolkit 2.4.3.
Click the office button, then activation tab, etc.

You can backup your activation files in MTK.
