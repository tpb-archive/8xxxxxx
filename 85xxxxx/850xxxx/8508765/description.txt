The first subjects exposed to The Presence went insane. Now a far more terrifying experiment is about to begin... A diverse group of unusual characters is airlifted to a remote mountain lodge. Here they hope to participate in a seance connecting them to the spirit world. David Kauffman and his teenage son have joined them to debunk a world-class psychic and expose her as a hoax. But not even David is prepared for what greets them. Still shaken by his daughter's death and his visits to heaven and hell, he's swept into a fantastic journey exposing the supernatural souls of men, where unseen thoughts become unimaginable reality. As the power of The Presence increases, the group must overcome their innermost passions or be destroyed by them. All this as they struggle to break free of their captor---the head of experiment and the murderer of David's daughter. Bestselling novelist Bill Myers weaves a supernatural thriller that will keep you turning pages late into the night---and thinking days after you've finished.
Unabridged.
