For the men of 'E' Easy Company the training is particularly difficult as a result of their demanding commander, Captain Herbert Sobel. He drives them incessantly to excel, canceling their weekend passes on a whim. His favorite chore is to have the men undertake a run up a hill known as Currahee. While the men are fit and ready for battle, thanks to Sobel, he has unfortunately shown himself to be a weak tactical commander. Once in England, and knowing they will soon be ...

He's been scrounging what he can, but it simply isn't enough.

Their artillery barrages take a heavy toll and several of the veterans of Easy Company are severely wounded including Bill Guarnere and Joe Toye.

The men of Easy Company are now in Germany, aware that the Germans are surrendering by the thousands and that the war is winding down.

That question is answered when they come across a concentration camp and they see first hand the atrocities committed by the Nazis. Captain Nixon has returned from a jump behind enemy lines that did not go well and resulted in many deaths. He's drinking ...

For those with enough service, it means a trip home while the rest continue to train for an eventual transfer to the war in the Pacific. For others still, tragedy still awaits. The men of the 101st all have varied futures ahead of ...
