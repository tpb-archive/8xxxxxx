Edgar is a waiter in a mediocre restaurant, where clients and even his mistress prove abusive, while his sick wife and criminal neighbors are no better. How bad it gets is a matter of discussion between Edgar, script-writer Herman, his meddling girl-friend Suzie and various other characters, who regularly complain to Herman, who thus repeatedly changes the script... yet never to everyone's satisfaction, least of all his own.
