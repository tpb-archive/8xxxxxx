Biblical Prophecies of Endtimes, Armageddon, Judgment, and Hell:
Unbelievers need to take Biblical Prophecy serious. Why? Because ancient prophecies told hundreds of years before they occurred have all come true up to this point--100% accuracy! Now...the only prophecies that are left so far describe persecution, hatred, murder, and the end of the world as we know it. All the others before them have come true. You think these won't???

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:
As Christians anticipate the imminent return of the Son of the Most High, Bible prophecy indicates that the world will soon go through unprecedented changes, which will take the great majority of us by surprise.

Satan, the father of lies and enemy of God, knows his time is short as prophetic signs point the imminent glorious return of the Son of God and Saviour of the human race, Jesus the Christ. Accordingly, Satan has agents including the Vatican and the antichrist pope, who has changed the holy ten commandments of God, along with the Illuminati and other secret societies. They are creating havoc on Earth, in anticipation of Satan's final attempt at deceiving the elect of the God -- the 144 000 -- who keep the commandments of the Most High and the faith of Christ (Revelation 14:12).

Satan is using the Antichrist pope and a myriad of secret societies and government organizations including the American Medical Association and the Food and Drug Administration to control, manipulate and decrease the world's population through triggered disasters, staged false flag attacks and other fear-mongering tactics to suppress individual rights and create a one world government including a one world religion, military, financial and economic system, with the Antichrist pope leading the charge.

Then, Satan will come in the flesh and masquerade himself as Christ to a deceived world, which has rejected the Christ of the Bible and His Law of love, His holy ten commandments. However, this false prophet will not be able to deceive the elect of the Most High as well as countless others, who will come to the knowledge of the truth, in these end times.

The false prophet will be the devil incarnate who will promote a false sense of peace and security when sudden destruction will fall upon the human race, who by then, will have rejected the Most High. He will also change the 7th day Sabbath commandment of the Most High which points to Him as the Creator to SUNday, the venerable day of the sun, in partnership with the Antichrist pope, to bring about Sunday laws worldwide.
