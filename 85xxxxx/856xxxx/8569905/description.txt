Radical Abundance: How a Revolution in Nanotechnology Will Change Civilization



K. Eric Drexler is the founding father of nanotechnologyΓÇöthe science of engineering on a molecular level. In Radical Abundance, he shows how rapid scientific progress is about to change our world. Thanks to atomically precise manufacturing, we will soon have the power to produce radically more of what people want, and at a lower cost. The result will shake the very foundations of our economy and environment.
 
Already, scientists have constructed prototypes for circuit boards built of millions of precisely arranged atoms. The advent of this kind of atomic precision promises to change the way we make thingsΓÇöcleanly, inexpensively, and on a global scale. It allows us to imagine a world where solar arrays cost no more than cardboard and aluminum foil, and laptops cost about the same.
 
A provocative tour of cutting edge science and its implications by the fieldΓÇÖs founder and master, Radical Abundance offers a mind-expanding vision of a world hurtling toward an unexpected future.
