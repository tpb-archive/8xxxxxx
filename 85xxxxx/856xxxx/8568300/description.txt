Fan-favorite character Travis Kidd -- the vampire hunter who likes to "bite them back" -- makes his return in this new AMERICAN VAMPIRE one-shot!

It's a story burned deep into the American psyche: two young lovers, a stolen car and the open road. But these young lovers are newly turned vampires trying to fight the bloodsucking urge inside them. To make matters worse, they've got a pack of angry vampires on their tails -- plus bad-ass vamp-killer Travis Kidd. He's tracking the "Heartbreak Killers" across the heartland, but can he stop them before it all ends in tragedy? This one-shot special sets the stage for the AMERICAN VAMPIRE relaunch later this year!
