         All The Time In The World


There's still a long way to go 
And the nights are closing in 
But if I travelled any faster babe 
Lord knows where I might have been 

Right from those early days 
I put my faith in the axle not the wheels 
Like old Zeno's toytus 
With Achilles snapping at my heels 

Don't worry 
There's no hurry 
Here we are 
With all the time in the world 

I could have been a high-flying dealer 
But I have no desire for speed 
I could have been a wild receiver 
But I've got everything I need 

And so I watch the world 
Go racing by tearing up the street 
I lay back in the long grass 
Take it easy and rest my feet 

Don't worry 
You know, there's no hurry 
Here we are 
With all the time in the world 

No-one ever held me back 
You know that no-one ever put me in chains 
No-one ever saw me racing ahead 
No-one had to tug on my reins 

As everybody knows 
I may be slow but I never quit 
Sometimes on a good day I sit and think 
Sometimes I just sit 

Don't worry 
Relax, there's no hurry 
Here we are 
With all the time in the world"
