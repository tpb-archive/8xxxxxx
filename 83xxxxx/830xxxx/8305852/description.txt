Nicknamed The Saint for how he devoted his life to God after a Bible stopped shrapnel from piercing his heart in battle, John hopes to somehow help his cousin, who lost his wife to African fever and whose daughter has been behaving strangely. But the moment he steps onto his cousin's sweltering estate, he begins seeing strange things and blacking out for hours on end. Soon, the young girl speaks of "She," an ethereal presence he's angered with his arrival. With each location you explore, each hidden object you find, each character you encounter, and each puzzle you solve, you'll not only move toward a shocking revelation but also piece together a cunning solution.
