AJAX (Asynchronous javascript and XML) is a group of interrelated web development 

techniques used on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications. With 


Ajax, web applications can send data to, and retrieve data from, a server 

asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior 

of the existing page. Data is usually retrieved using the XMLHttpRequest object.

 Despite the name, the use of XML is not required (JSON is often used instead), and 

the requests do not need to be asynchronous. Ajax is not a single technology, but a 

group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in combination to mark up and style 

information. The DOM is accessed with javascript to dynamically display, and to allow 

the user to interact with the information presented. javascript and the

 XMLHttpRequest object provide a method for exchanging data asynchronously between 

browser and server to avoid full page reloads
