In this all-new miniseries, a spaceship crashes into a separatist camp and manages to reanimate the dead as well! It's aliens vs. zombies vs. militiamen in a carnage-filled tale from the co-creator of Zombies vs Robots! And if that ain't enough, covers for this series will be by acclaimed Cerebus creator, Dave Sim!
