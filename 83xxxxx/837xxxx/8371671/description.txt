
Note: Tommow night, Sunday April 14, midnight I escalate this DeathFast, no on Day 17, by terminating all liquids. [google: start loving Ecocide's Death Fast]  The Point?  This last batch of uploads must happen before then, and to do so I'm on my 7th day of working 21 hours per day, non-stop. How this avatar is holding up is beyond me.  If you are looking for slick entertainment, nice and tidy uploads, perfection, go away from here.

But even with my near-death fatigue, if you do your part, this Library of Unviolent Revolution - Agape, Universal Family, at UnviolentPeaceMaker fills the strategy void in averting ecocide for our next 200 billion kids, IF YOU WILL USE IT, SHARE IT, KEEP ESPECIALLY THE WEAKER SEEDS ALIVE.  I've done my part.  Now, follow the examples litering this Library, and do yours.  Goodbye now, UnviolentPeacemaker.

NOTICE: Why screw these great authors, these great brothers and sisters?  Don't.  Buy these materials, preferably from a locally owned and operated store.  But in the meantime, get digesting this material.  Do you think you will remember, 10 yers from now, do you think you will remember what song, or talk show, or news program you were listening to today driving to work, or hiking to class, jogging?

THOSE CLUELESS TO THE PLANETARY EMERGENCY OF IMPENDING ECOCIDE SHOULD GO ELSEWHERE.  These uploads were created for me, to equip me to Wage All-out Unviolent War for my current and future 204 billion children.  If you are looking for style over substance this site and these materials are not for you.  THE PRESENT AND FUTURE KIDS ARE SCREAMING AT US TO SAVE THEIR FUTURE, not whether there are typos, hugely rough parts, audio artifacts, pauses, footnote numbers, etc.  HAVE THE DECENCY NOT TO COMPLAIN.


ALSO, CUT ME SOME SLICK.  THIS UPLOAD WAS PREPARED ON 04.11.13, THIS DAY 14 OF MY 'ECOCIDE'S DEATH FAST, ZERO CALORIES,' RACING TO FINISH THIS PROJECT SO I CAN ABSTAIN FROM LIQUIDS AS WELL BY MIDNIGHHT SUNDAY NIGHT. GOOGLE 'start loving.' Also GOOGLE, 'tracking plan b'  So, I'm working with a 23,400 calorie deficit, and a sleep deficit the last 4 days of near 8 hrs x 4 = 32 hours, so I can get this done, before I am.  (Hmmm, you too are this committed to averting ecocide so out kids and grandkids have a Life, like you and I did, right?)


WITHIN WEEKS I'LL BE GONE.  FOR CREATION'S SAKE, SEED THESE.  KEEP EVERY ONE, ESPECIALLY THE WEAKEST, ALIVE WHILE I'M GONE.  OK? STARTING NOW?

OH! A final note.  This project, on now a 4 day near zero sleep sprint, may be A. one of the wonders of human endurance, or B. full of technical disasters, errors....  I've devoted my life to have it be the former.  If it is the latter, ROFL, I WON'T BE AROUND FOR YOU TO WHINE AT, RIDICULE, BLAME!!!!  FIX IT, BUILD ON IT. DO YOUR PART!  UnviolentPeacemaker
