High atop a snow-covered hill, the stately old Wyatt mansion is perched like a crown, its stone spires pointing upward, its stained glass windows glowing like colorful jewels. Such opulence means success and, surely, happiness. But on the eve of wealthy philanthropist Cecil WyattΓÇÖs eightieth birthday, all the money in the world wonΓÇÖt bring back his missing grandson, William Wyatt. The only thing for certain: Foul play was involved.

The family, the police, the mediaΓÇôall have tried in vain to discover the young manΓÇÖs fate. Now suspicion has turned shockingly toward WilliamΓÇÖs own half-brother, the rather distant and enigmatic Mitchell Wyatt.

Kate Donovan never dreamed that a chance romantic encounter on a tropical island paradise would tag her as a suspect in a high-society murder case. But after Kate tangles with the darkly charismatic Mitchell Wyatt, she finds herself cast in a shadow of guilt and mistrust. As the Chicago police tighten their net, it will take all of KateΓÇÖs ingenuity to clear her name. With her calm, cool wit, and the help of a man who may or may not be a dangerous catch, Kate vows to claim the life and love she desires
