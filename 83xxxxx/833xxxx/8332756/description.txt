Ugly Valley Boys - Double Down (2011) mp3


From Salt Lake City, The Ugly Valley Boys evoke the lonesome sound of the desert, the classic soul of country, and the open space of the West in original songs that are wickedly engaging and smartly crafted. So many bands try to imbibe their music with a vintage feel and Western space by using copious amounts of chorus or reverb, or blowing wads of cash on vintage gear. Ugly Valleys guitar player, singer, and songwriter Ryan Eastlyn takes the road less traveled with the use of moaning, melodic chorus lines that are so excellent, they vault this band from a relative unknown to one responsible for one of the better albums put out so far in 2011.

The album starts off with a track about running moonshine, the pigeon-holing was just about complete. Thats when the song, Raven hit my ears, and the genius behind the Ugly Valley Boys revealed itself, separating them far from the herd.

The melodic chorus-driven songs with punk undertones are counterbalanced by dark and gritty deep roots songs that could be considered just as much blues as country. As impressed as I am by Eateryns ear in crafting the vocals in these songs, without any message or meaning behind the lyrics, the experience would be shallow. The Ugly Valley Boys pull you in with Braxtons engaging rhythm and Ryans voice, but what keeps you engaged is the soul embedded in the songwriting.
 
I could break down each song on this album, but I donΓÇÖt see the point. ThereΓÇÖs not a bad song here. At the moment, the track that most impresses me is Alota Guns, but this album shows all the earmarks of one whose best track changes by week, until every song has filled that slot and after a couple of months you look down and this CD is still stuck in the player.
