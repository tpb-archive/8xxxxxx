A well-off accountant and a beloved wife and mother, Marta Dickenson doesnΓÇÖt seem the type to be on anyone's hit list. But when Eve and her partner, Peabody, find blood inside the building, the lieutenant knows Marta's murder was the work of a killer who's trained, but not professional or smart enough to remove all the evidence.

And as the killer's violent streak begins to escalate, Eve knows she has to draw him out, even if it means using herself as bait
