I've tuned it all in my mind
I sang by the piano
Tore my yellow dress and
Cried and cried and cried

And I'd want to see what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Let the morning come, come

Now there's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry
Over the love of youth

On this champagne-drunken home
Against the current of old
Everybody see I love him
Cause it's the feeling that you get
When the afternoon is set
On the bridge into the city

And I want to see what I've seen
To undo what has been done
Turn off all the lights
Let the morning come

There's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry

'Cause you're a hard soul to save
With an ocean in the way
But I'll get around it
I'll get around it
'Cause you're a hard soul to save
With an ocean in the way
But I'll get around it
I'll get around it

There's green light in my eyes
And my lover on my mind
And I sing from the piano
Tear my yellow dress and
Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of youth

Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of youth
(I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes)
Cry and cry and cry and
Over the love of youth

I can see the green light
I can see it in your eyes
