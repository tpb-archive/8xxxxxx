This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

In this pack, Ferry Corsten. No matter what major event you go to, you can almost be guaranteed that his tracks or remixes will be played. That was true years ago, and is still true now. The number one remixed tune of all time (if I am correctly led to believe) is none other than Punk. I have seen Ferry play many times and I can tell you that when the first tell-tale beats of this track come on, the crowd simply erupts. A set he played at Home Sydney once was winding after three of four hours and it sounded like the lasdt track was being played, folks were starting to wander off the dancefloor, Punk hadn't been played. I assume everyone was feeling like me, wishing that it had been in there, but thinking he can't play it EVERY SINGLE TIME he DJ's - so okay... maybe next time... The turntable was winding down and down, to the point where the music was almost unidentifiable... then BAM! That sound was morphed into the unmistakable sound of the Punk intro. I have never ever in my life seen a club erupt like that. The cheers for a split second drowned out the music itself as a crowd of people sprinted and charged back to the dancefloor as if all falling from different directions towards the center of the earth. Sheer magic.

Now, add in Out of the Blue, Rock your Body Rock, L.E.F. and all the others and can start to imagine just how big this guy is. This is a huge pack, I have been lucky to track down some amazing sets here. Before you grab the calculator and try to work out how many hours 7536 minutes make, it is over 125 hours.
