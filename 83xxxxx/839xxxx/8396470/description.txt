3 Doors Down is an American rock band from Escatawpa, Mississippi who formed in 1996. The band originally consisted of Brad Arnold (vocals/drums), Todd Harrell (bass) and Matt Roberts (guitar). They took in Chris Henderson in the very early days of The Better Life's creation and released the album as a 4 piece band. Richard Liles played drums for the band during their touring stint on that record. From 2002 - 2005 The band hired Daniel Adair as a "touring" drummer and took off to play nearly 1000 shows as this formation all across the world in support of their hugely successful 'Away From The Sun' album. In 2005, when Daniel Adair was hired full-time by Nickelback, 3 Doors Down took on Greg Upchurch (Puddle Of Mudd) to play drums full-time. In 2012; the band released a statement explaining an issue with original guitarist Matt Roberts' health, leading to his departure from 3 Doors Down to take time away from the busy life of being a rockstar. This movement created space for Chet Roberts to fill. Roberts was Chris Henderson's guitar tech previously.[1]
