This is part of my Gods Collection, basically a set of files that are from superstars of the Trance, Techno and generally Rave scene. The names that really get people to fork out for the tickets. Putting together collections of old or rare sets from around the world. While one of two of these are already on the site, I really think putting them together by artist like this will make for some torrents that hang around for a long time. The bitrate shown in the header is probably an average, these are from many sources over many years.

Paul Van Dyk probably got a better opening gig as a DJ than most. His first appearance as a DJ was in the Tresor in March 1991. Since then things haven't gone downhill, he has been awarded more accolades than most other DJ's and could play at any venue in the world on a minutes notice. He has enough remixes under his belt that have stood the test of time, the test of the dancefloors and the test of the charts to make anyone proud, but his political views, his charity work and efforts to help those who can't help themselves makes him quite unique. No more banter, here is over fourteen hours of the finest.
