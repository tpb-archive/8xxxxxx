Steven Gould - Jumper and Reflex

JUMPER

Davy lives alone with his father. But the truth is, it isn't much of a home. When things get so bad that Davy decides to run away, his big question is, Where? And how will he live?

The magical answer: anywhere Davy wants!

Davy discovers he has the power to "jump" from one place to another. Not just a few feet. But hundreds, even thousands of miles! And as Davy explores his new power he learns that the world is literally his for the taking. But there are consequences too, as Davy will learn.



REFLEX

Davy has always been alone. He believes that he's the only person in the world who can teleport. But what if he isn't?

A mysterious group of people has taken Davy captive. They don't want to hire him, and they don't have any hope of appealing to him to help them. What they want is to own him. They want to use his abilities for their own purposes, whether Davy agrees to it or not. And so they set about brainwashing him and conditioning him. They have even found a way to keep a teleport captive.

But there's one thing that they don't know. No one knows it, not even Davy. And it might save his life....
