In 1998, thirty four unidentified bodies were found in shallow graves in a remote Siberian forest. After subsequent investigations, no official explanation by the Russian authorities was ever offered about the circumstances of the deaths. The case was closed. In 2010, a small English TV crew from the show ΓÇÿDarkest SecretsΓÇÖ set out for the Siberian forest. ΓÇÿDarkest SecretsΓÇÖ focuses on revisiting the sites of unsolved crimes and they employ the gifts of a psychic whose extraordinary powers may help shed new light on cold cases. The last communication to their production office in London stated that they were approaching the Siberian region where the bodies were found. Nothing was heard from them again. ΓÇÿEntityΓÇÖ is the story of what happened to them. The forest was only the beginning..
