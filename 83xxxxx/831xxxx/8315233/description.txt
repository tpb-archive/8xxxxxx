The Chaos Edition features 23 playable races, including 3 that are totally new, each offering its own game style! Make a competitive team, train it and buy the best equipment. Brutal victory after victory, improve your players' skills to make them into true Blood Bowl players! This is a no holds barred bonecrunching sport! Even if tactics are your favored route, you can also choose from a large selection of incredible and vicious moves: bribe the ref, devastating spells or illegal weaponsΓÇª

In the Chaos Edition, three new races are making their triumphant arrival on the field: the malevolent Chaos Dwarfs, the outcasts of the Underworld teams and, for the very first time in Blood Bowl, the Daemons of Khorne! The new Lizardmen Stadium is more than ready to welcome all new teams, along with a new challenging mode, World Cup: participate in a prestigious competition, and lead your team from the qualifications to the bloody final tournament!

Blood Bowl can be played online. Create your team, improve it and lead it to the top of the official rankings! Develop your own private internet league to organize your own tournaments!
