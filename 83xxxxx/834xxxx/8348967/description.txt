Evoland is a journey through the history of action/adventure
gaming, allowing you to unlock new technologies, gameplay systems
and graphic upgrades as you progress through the game. Inspired by
many cult series that have left their mark in the RPG video gaming
culture, Evoland takes you from monochrome to full 3D graphics and
from active time battles to real time boss fights, all with plenty
of humor and references to many classic games.

- Discover many evolutions, from old school 2D action/adventure to
active time battles and full 3D action
- Revisit the starting area rendered in full 3D or explore the
overworld with your own airship!

uncover, and dozens of achievements and stars to collect
