For Abby Renard, the plan was supposed to be simpleΓÇöjoin her brothersΓÇÖ band on the last leg of their summer tour and decide if sheΓÇÖs finally ready for the limelight by becoming its fourth member. Of course, she never imagined stumbling onto the wrong tour bus at Rock Nation would accidentally land her in the bed of Jake Slater, the notorious womanizing lead singer of Runaway Train. When he mistakes her for one of his groupieΓÇÖs, Abby quickly lets him know she sure as hell isn't in his bed on purpose.

Jake Slater never imagined the angel who fell into his bed would resist his charms by promptly kneeing him in the balls. Of course, the fact she seems like a prissy choir girl makes her anything but his type. So he is more than surprised when after betting Abby she wouldnΓÇÖt last a week on their tour bus, she is more than willing to prove him wrong. But as JakeΓÇÖs personal life begins to implode around him, he finds an unlikely ally in Abby. HeΓÇÖs never met a woman he can talk to, joke with, or most importantly make music with.

As the week starts comes to a close, neither Abby nor Jake is ready to let go. Can a sweetheart Country songstress and a bad boy of Rock N Roll actually have a future together? 


Seed and Enjoy!
