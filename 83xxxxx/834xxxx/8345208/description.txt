From GEPR:  Here's a concept ... Russian Space Rock. And an excellent concept it is, too. The Russian Boheme Music label has recently re-released the Return LP on CD, and it sounds great. The leader of this band was Maxim Pshenichny who went on to record at least one solo album, but I am unable to find information on this or any of the other Rainy Season LP's.

Return consists of three long cuts. The first two were obviously Side 1 of the original LP, and the third was a side-long cut on Side 2. The first two cuts might be described as Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour playing lead guitar with Daevid Allen doing spacey background chords using his "glissandoz guitar" technique and Pierre Moerlin playing percussive (marimba?) ostinatos. So it sounds a bit like Pink Floyd meets Gong. There's also a crazed guitar-synth solo on the first cut which doesn't sound like anything I've heard before ... very cool.

The third 20-minute long cut is far more electronic in its sound. Moody dark synths burble away as a backdrop to improvs over the top of both guitar and synth (or maybe that's an organ, though not a Hammond). It's mostly pretty hypnotic/melodic, though it does sometimes break up into atonal cacaphonies which slowly crystallize into melodies again. Very nicely done.

This album turns out to be one of my favorites from the Boheme collection. Highly recommended.
