A study of the years spent at Giverny, by the artist Claude Monet (1840-1926).
Unlike most art books, this small volume has been in print continuously since 1978 & when you read it, it isn't hard to see why: superb reproductions and an extremely elegant design (plus its small size - very unusual in art publishing) offer the reader a wonderful experience wandering in Monet's vision of a carefully constructed alternate reality. In Monet's Giverny, natural forms respond instantly to light. The images produce a peculiar sense of floating in the viewer - many of the pictures lack a horizon line or any indication of where the viewer is in relation to the picture. As a result, we seem to hover in flight, poised above a constantly shifting panorama of woods, water, fields, and lilies. Interestingly, no human figures are visible in these works (Monet was never really a figure painter) producing a peculiar sensation of isolation and contemplation in the spectator - we wander through this magical land alone, or with whatever companion we desire. A superlative achievement which has found few imitators in the world of art publishing.
