Seenu (Ram) enjoys fights right from his childhood. He appreciates violence. He wants to be like Manikyam (Pradeep Rawat), who was a goonda, as everyone, including his teacher, is afraid of him. When all the boys wanted to become doctors, engineers, lawyers and other professionals, Seenu wants to become a goonda. Though he behaves like a ruffian, he comes to know that one should have the support of a politician or a big dada. With the help of Laddu (A.S. Ravikumar Chowdary) an associate of Manikyam, Seenu meets the latter and joins his gang. At this juncture, Seenu falls in love with Subbalakshmi (Isha Sahni). As she pleads with Seenu to help her friend's father, Seenu agrees to settle a land deal. But the land was under illegal occupation of Manikyam's gang member.
As he promised to settle the deal, Seenu opposes Manikyam. This makes Seenu a hero, and he also starts doing settlements on his own. Once, Seenu agrees to help an industrialist, whose quarry was occupied by Yadav (Satya Prakash), with the support of Manikyam. As things go out of control, Seenu decides to kill Yadav.
However, he could not kill him but Seenu's young brother, who also likes fighting scenes, takes the gun and kills Yadav. Seenu appeals to the police commissioner (Prakash Raj) to mediate with Manikyam, but his men kill Seenu's brother. This irks Seenu who severely thrashes Manikyam, but spares him. Seenu realizes that violence is not the way to go. When Manikyam attacks him, he kills him in self-defense. The film ends on a happy note, with Seenu leaving all the dadagiri and leads a normal life.
