The Bridge is a 2D logic puzzle game that forces the player to  reevaluate
their preconceptions of physics and perspective. It is Isaac Newton  meets
M. C. Escher. Manipulate gravity to redefine  the  ceiling  as  the  floor
while venturing through  impossible  architectures.  Explore  increasingly
difficult worlds, each uniquely detailed and designed to leave the  player
with  a  pronounced  sense  of  intellectual  accomplishment.  The  Bridge
exemplifies games as an art form, with beautifully hand-drawn art  in  the
style of a black-and-white lithograph.


 Features:
 ~~~~~~~~~
* 48 thought-provoking puzzles, each unique from the rest, all requiring
  an innovative solution.
* Gravity manipulations, gravitational vortexes, parallel dimensions, and
  many more mind-bending concepts in a world where the laws of physics are
  not what they seem.
* M. C. Escher-esque worlds with impossible architecture set in the style
  of beautifully hand-drawn black-and-white lithographic art.
* An alternate version of the game unlocked after the main storyline has
  been completed, including challenging alternate versions of each of the
  24 main puzzles, along with an alternate ending.
* A time-backtracking system to alleviate any fears of making a mistake.
