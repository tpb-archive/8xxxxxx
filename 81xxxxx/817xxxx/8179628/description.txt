The South Pacific theatre of World War II is usually seen from the perspective of the Marines fighting from Guadalcanal to Okinawa. Unsung in WWII fiction is the story of the 6th Army's 6th Infantry Division ('the Sightseein' Sixth') and their jungle commandoes, the Alamo Scouts, under the command of Gen. Walter Kreuger, the trusted and savvy lieutenant of 'America's Caesar,' Douglas MacArthur. Fever Ridge explores unique events, perspectives, exotic locales and peoples that are different than any you have encountered in other WWII storiesΓÇª and ultimately is the story of a secret that could have changed the War, and the world.
