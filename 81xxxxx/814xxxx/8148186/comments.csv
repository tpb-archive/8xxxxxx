I know that it's over 
 But I can't believe we're through
 They said that time's a healer
 And I'm better without you
 It's gonna take time I know
 But I'll get over you


 Look at my life 
 Look at my heart
 I have seen them fall apart
 Now I'm ready to rise again
 Look at my hopes 
 Look at my dreams
 I'm building bridges from these scenes
 Now I'm ready to rise again

 Caught up in my thinking, yeah
 Like a prisoner in my mind
 You pose so many questions 
 But the truth was hard to find
 I better think twice I know
 That I'll get over you


 Much time has passed between us 
 Do you still think of me at all?
 My world of broken promises
 Now you won't catch me when I fall
