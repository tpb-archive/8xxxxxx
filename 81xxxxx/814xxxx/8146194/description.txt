Picking up where Peter V. Brett's Red Sonja: Blue one-shot left off, with Sonja fleeing the scene of a murder after killing a young man who tried to test her vow. Bereft of her signature chain-mail and the reputation that goes with it, she must rely on her wits and her sword as she embarks on a new series of adventures. Guilt-ridden, penniless and on the run, she is unaware that the innocent blood she spilled has awakened the dark spirit of the demon whose pelt she wears.
