Eleusis is a 3d first-person adventure game for Windows developed by
Nocturnal Works. It takes place in a seemingly abandoned village in Greece
where the player character, while trying to seek refuge, finds himself
in the center of a whirlwind of mysterious events. As the plot unfolds
he finds clues that indicate that the village is a nest of a cult which
plans to revive a dark force through an ancient ritual and harness its
power. The player character faces the challenge of unlocking the forgotten
knowledge of the ancient mysteries in order to stop the cult from
accomplishing their goal. It is an exploration based adventure game where
the player is called to solve the mystery by finding clues and reading
various texts based on actual history, mythology and technology of ancient
Greece.
