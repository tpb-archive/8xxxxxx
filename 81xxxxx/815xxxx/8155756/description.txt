David Rosen - I Just Want My Pants Back


Jason Strider is a twentysomething young man with an English degree from an Ivy League university, a very small apartment in New York, a vapid job as a receptionist at a casting agency-and no particular idea what to do with his life. On most evenings he gets stoned and goes out, sometimes with his long time best friend and wingman Tina and sometimes alone, if not get laid then at least to get hammered enough to really regret it the next day and be late for work. 

Then one night Jason has athletic, appliance-assisted intercourse with a cute girl named Jane-and ends up lending her his favorite Dickies jeans. Many unanswered email and text messages later, he is reduced to the complaint 'I just want my pants back.' How he does, in a most unexpected way, find those pants and how he is forced to face his immaturity-and mortality-are at the heart of this smart, raunchily comic and deeply affecting novel.
