Class 390 updated for Train Simulator 2013

The Class 390 is a modern classic, and you can experience the speed of this powerful tilting express train from the driverΓÇÖs seat in Train Simulator. The Class 390 is one of the fastest electric multiple units operating in Britain. The set can reach 140 mph, whilst featuring tilting train technology to allow higher speeds around bends. At present, the Class 390 operates along the West Coast Main Line and is well-known to commuters and railfans alike for its sleek looks and high performance. In 2006 a Class 390 set a new speed record along the West Coast Main Line, completing the 401-mile trip from London to Glasgow in 3 hours and 55 minutes, and in usual operation the sets will run up to 125mph where track conditions allow. The Class 390 for Train Simulator recreates the smooth high performance well-known to drivers on the West Coast 
Main Line, and features a realistic tilting function which mimics the action of the real thing.
