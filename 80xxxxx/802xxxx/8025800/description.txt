In the not-too-distant past, the first nuclear weapon test changed the world forever... but not in the way we expected. Unleashed upon the planet was a microscopic technological virus of unknown origin that infected millions-some to no effect, some to horrifying agonies and disfigurement, others with the gift of incredible and sometimes terrifying power. But would a world populated by supermen become a battleground for good against bad... or bad against worse? Is it true that with great power comes great responsibility... or does it truly come with great license?

Dark Horse Heroes Omnibus collects "Comics Greatest World" and "Will to Power", the two hit maxiseries created by Dark Horse Comics that turned the concept of the superhero universe on its head, bringing together an all-star team of creators.
