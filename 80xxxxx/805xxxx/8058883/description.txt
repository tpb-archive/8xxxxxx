Description:
This city-building game is the follow-up to the Caesar and Pharaoh games. You'll take the role of a city ruler and the gameplay will involve provisioning your people, controlling industry and production and constructing buildings for religious worship and entertainment. You'll have to keep the gods appeased and the famous heroes, such as Hercules, will also make an appearance. The game will be played on a 3D landscape viewed from an isometric perspective. Cities will be populated with many types of people who will be seen moving around. The game's promises to graphical improvements over Pharaoh.
