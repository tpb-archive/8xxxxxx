The Gulag--a vast array of Soviet concentration camps that held millions of political 

and criminal prisoners--was a system of repression and punishment that terrorized the 

entire society, embodying the worst tendencies of Soviet communism. In this 

magisterial and acclaimed history, Anne Applebaum offers the first fully documented 

portrait of the Gulag, from its origins in the Russian Revolution, through its 

expansion under Stalin, to its collapse in the era of glasnost. Applebaum intimately 

re-creates what life was like in the camps and links them to the larger history of 

the Soviet Union. Immediately recognized as a landmark and long-overdue work of 

scholarship, Gulag is an essential book for anyone who wishes to understand the 

history of the twentieth century.
