Storyline

In April of 1945, Germany stands at the brink of defeat with the Soviet Armies closing
in from the west and south. In Berlin, capital of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler proclaims
that Germany will still achieve victory and orders his Generals and advisers to fight
to the last man. "Downfall" explores these final days of the Reich, where senior German leaders
(such as Himmler and Goring) began defecting from their beloved Fuhrer, in an effort to
save their own lives, while still others (Joseph Goebbels) pledge to die with Hitler.
Hitler, himself, degenerates into a paranoid shell of a man, full of optimism one moment
and suicidal depression the next. When the end finally does comes, and Hitler lies dead
by his own hand, what is left of his military must find a way to end the killing that
is the Battle of Berlin, and lay down their arms in surrender.
