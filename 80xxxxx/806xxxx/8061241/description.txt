To make his biggest score, HanΓÇÖs ready to take even bigger risks.
But even he canΓÇÖt do this job solo.
 
Han Solo should be basking in his moment of glory. After all, the cocky smuggler and captain of the Millennium Falcon just played a key role in the daring raid that destroyed the Death Star and landed the first serious blow to the Empire in its war against the Rebel Alliance. But after losing the reward his heroics earned him, HanΓÇÖs got nothing to celebrate. Especially since heΓÇÖs deep in debt to the ruthless crime lord Jabba the Hutt. ThereΓÇÖs a bounty on HanΓÇÖs headΓÇöand if he canΓÇÖt cough up the credits, heΓÇÖll surely pay with his hide. The only thing that can save him is a kingΓÇÖs ransom. Or maybe a gangsterΓÇÖs fortune? ThatΓÇÖs what a mysterious stranger is offering in exchange for HanΓÇÖs less-than-legal help with a riskier-than-usual caper. The payoff will be more than enough for Han to settle up with JabbaΓÇöand ensure he never has to haggle with the Hutts again.
 
All he has to do is infiltrate the ultra-fortified stronghold of a Black Sun crime syndicate underboss and crack the galaxyΓÇÖs most notoriously impregnable safe. It sounds like a job for miracle workers . . . or madmen. So Han assembles a gallery of rogues who are a little of bothΓÇöincluding his indispensable sidekick Chewbacca and the cunning Lando Calrissian. If anyone can dodge, deceive, and defeat heavily armed thugs, killer droids, and Imperial agents alikeΓÇöand pull off the heist of the centuryΓÇöitΓÇÖs SoloΓÇÖs scoundrels. But will their crime really pay, or will it cost them the ultimate price?
