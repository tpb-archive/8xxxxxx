Originally based on the Danish series, Big Brother headed to the UK on Channel 4 in 2000. Proving a massive success a spin-off featuring celebrity housemates was launched in March 2001 in aid of Comic Relief. The first series lasted a full week and raised over ?500,000 for the charity. Any money made from the show's phone lines since goes directly to charity.
