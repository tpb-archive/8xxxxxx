Jay is too spoiled to inherit his grandfather's vast wealth. When he fails to graduate from college, his grandfather's will sends him back to his ancestral village where, long ago, he made a friend. Shikha, Jay's estranged childhood friend, helps Jay rediscover his humanity. But, Shikha is very sick. She shared her dreams with Jay - to rebuild the orphanage where she lives. Jay realizes that this life where he can choose nothing, where money buys nothing important, is dearer to him than a full of privilege. Can he save Shikha and marry her? Will their dream come true? Will Jay re-inherit his ancestral wealth?
