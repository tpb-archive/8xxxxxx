A New York Times bestselling author explores cutting-edge brain science to learn where talent comes from, how it grows and how we can make ourselves smarter. 
How does a penniless Russian tennis club with one indoor court create more top 20 women players than the entire United States? How did a small town in rural Italy produce the dozens of painters and sculptors who ignited the Italian Renaissance? Why are so many great soccer players from Brazil? 
Where does talent come from, and how does it grow? 
New research has revealed that myelin, once considered an inert form of insulation for brain cells, may be the holy grail of acquiring skill. Journalist Daniel Coyle spent years investigating talent hotbeds, interviewing world-class practitioners (top soccer players, violinists, fighter, pilots, artists, and bank robbers) and neuroscientists. In clear, accessible language, he presents a solid strategy for skill acquisition in athletics, fine arts, languages, science or math that can be successfully applied through a person 's entire lifespan.
