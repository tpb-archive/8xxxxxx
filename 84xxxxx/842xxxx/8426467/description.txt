Vanessa Greene: The Vintage Teacup Club

AZW3, EPUB, MOBI

At a car boot sale in Sussex, three very different women meet and fall for the same vintage teaset. They decide to share it - and form a friendship that changes their lives . . . 

Jenny can't wait to marry Dan. Then, after years of silence, she hears from the woman who could shatter her dreams. 

Maggie has put her broken heart behind her and is gearing up for the biggest event of her career - until she's forced to confront the past once more. 

Alison seems to have it all: married to her childhood sweetheart, with two gorgeous daughters. But as tensions mount, she is pushed to breaking point. 

Dealing with friendship and families, relationships and careers, highs and lows, The Vintage Teacup Club is heart-warming storytelling at its very best.
