 : Told with P. D. James's trademark suspense, insightful characterization,   :
 : and riveting storytelling, The Children of Men is a story of a world with  :
 : no children and no future. The human race has become infertile, and the    :
 : last generation to be born is now adult. Civilization itself is crumbling  :
 : as suicide and despair become commonplace. Oxford historian Theodore Faron,:
 : apathetic toward a future without a future, spends most of his time        :
 : reminiscing. Then he is approached by Julian, a bright, attractive woman   :
 : who wants him to help get her an audience with his cousin, the powerful    :
 : Warden of England. She and her band of unlikely revolutionaries may just   :
 : awaken his desire to live... and they may also hold the key to survival    :
 : for the human race.                                                        :
