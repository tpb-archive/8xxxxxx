Take the role of a mighty Master and shape the destiny of Eador, on land and within the astral plane itself.  Explore the land and rule provinces as you see fit, defend them, and keep the populace in line or they may rebel. Choose from thousands of items--swords, spells, weapons, armor, and more--to outfit the heroes you recruit so they may best meet any challenge. Keep your heroes healthy and they will grow stronger as they gain experience from battle. Forge alliances and engage in the delicate art of diplomacy as you negotiate trade agreements or wage war against a mutual foe. Eador, with its many wonders and adventures, awaits. Will you answer the call?
