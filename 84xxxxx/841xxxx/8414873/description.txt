Game information
=================

StarDrive sets a new benchmark for the '4X Space Strategy' genre. Starting
with a single planet and a small number of space-worthy vessels, you  must
venture forth into the galaxy, conquer new worlds, build new colonies  and
defend your very existence against those who would take what is yours. How
you play is your decision. Use diplomacy or brute force.  Trade,  spy  and
research your way to galactic domination. Make friends, or  create  mortal
enemies

The heart of StarDrive is its ship design and combat engine

StarDrive takes a modular approach to ship design, allowing the player  to
create custom ships where the composition and placement  of  ship  modules
really matters to the performance of a ship.. In combat, if your  portside
armour is taking a beating, then rotate around and show them the starboard
side Hide behind a friendly capital ship's shields warp into and out  of
the  fray,  launch  fighters,  lay  mines,  and  so  much    more
