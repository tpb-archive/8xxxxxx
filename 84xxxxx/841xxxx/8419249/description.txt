Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
As I move that street
As I walk block block
As I move that street
As I walk block block

Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me

Oh, oh

Stay out here
Stay out here
It is happening

They work the world as it will be
Is now when they dance
Just so just now, the euro falls
Our short century
Times Square, unauthorized, you me
Are you on your way?
Just so just how, I hear the call
Our short century

You have the most original way
of putting one foot in front of the other

One foot yours, one mine
One foot yours, one mine
One foot yours, one mine
One foot yours, one mine

Stay out here
Stay out here
It is happening

That bridge my back was my first song
Lose and down, been long
And this time, this time, this time, time
What is remembered?

We're too much
How to stay un-down

You have the most beautiful way
of putting one foot in front of the other

Being horizontal is wonderful
Most things we love are open ended

Stay out here
Stay out here

Ooooooooooohhh
Lose your way, love me

Most things we love are open ended
stay out here, it will get more frightening
lose your way, your way
lose your way, your way

putting one foot in front of the other
putting one foot in front of the other
putting one foot in front of the other
putting one foot in front of the other

Most things we love are open ended
stay out here, it will get more frightening

Lose a wall, love me
Lose a wall, love me
As I move that street
(As I move that street)
As I walk block block
(As I walk block block)
As I make shape across your lawn

As I walk block block
As I walk block block
As I walk block block
