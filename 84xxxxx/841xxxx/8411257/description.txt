19 year old Jared Price leaves the stability of his home in Georgia to start a new life in Southern California. With only a bag on his back and a few hundred dollars, he sets out on an emotional journey of self realization and sexual discovery. Stumbling through the tight quarters of a Hollywood youth hostel, he befriends a young neighbor who is eager to pursue a more than platonic friendship. Soon, Jared gains employment as a personal caretaker for Mrs. Haines, a wealthy, older, blind woman, and falls into a deceptive relationship with her affluent, older son, Matthew. When the relationship becomes personally destructive, Jared is faced once again with the difficult task of abandoning his stability to risk his heart.
