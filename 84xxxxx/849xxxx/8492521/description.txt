Microelectronics: Circuit Analysis and Design is intended as a core text in electronics for undergraduate electrical and computer engineering students. The fourth edition continues to provide a foundation for analyzing and designing both analog and digital electronic circuits. The goal has always been to make this book very readable and student friendly.
An accessible approach to learning through clear writing and practical pedagogy has become the hallmark of Microelectronics: Circuit Analysis and Design by Donald Neamen. Now in its fourth edition, the text builds upon its strong pedagogy and tools for student assessment with key updates as well as revisions that allow for flexible coverage of op-amps.

Richard Jaeger and Travis Blalock present a balanced coverage of analog and digital circuits; students will develop a comprehensive understanding of the basic techniques of modern electronic circuit design, analog and digital, discrete and integrated.

A broad spectrum of topics are included in Microelectronic Circuit Design which gives the professor the option to easily select and customize the material to satisfy a two-semester or three-quarter sequence in electronics. Jaeger/Blalock emphasizes design through the use of design examples and design notes. Excellent pedagogical elements include chapter opening vignettes, chapter objectives, ΓÇ£Electronics in ActionΓÇ¥ boxes, a problem-solving methodology, and "Design NoteΓÇ¥ boxes.

The use of the well-defined problem-solving methodology presented in this text can significantly enhance an engineerΓÇÖs ability to understand the issues related to design. The design examples assist in building and understanding the design process.

MICROELECTRONIC CIRCUITS: ANALYSIS AND DESIGN combines a "breadth-first" approach to teaching electronics with a strong emphasis on electronics design and simulation. Professor Rashid first introduces students to the general characteristics of circuits (ICs) to prepare them for the use of circuit design and analysis techniques. He then moves on to a more detailed study of devices and circuits and how they operate within ICs. This approach makes the text easily adaptable to both one- and two-term electronics courses. Student's gain a strong systems perspective, and can readily fill in device-level detail as the course (and their job) requires. In addition, Rashid, author of five successful texts on PSpice and power electronics, directly addresses student's needs for applying theory to real-world design problems by mastering the use of PSpice for testing and verifying their designs. More than 50% of the problems and examples in the text concentrate on design, with PSpice used extensively in the design problems.

The microelectronics evolution has given rise to many modern benefits but has also changed design methods and attitudes to learning. Technology advancements shifted focus from simple circuits to complex systems with major attention to high-level descriptions. The design methods moved from a bottom-up to a top-down approach.
For todayΓÇÖs students, the most beneficial approach to learning is this top-down method that demonstrates a global view of electronics before going into specifics. Franco Maloberti uses this approach to explain the fundamentals of electronics, such as processing functions, signals and their properties. Here he presents a helpful balance of theory, examples, and verification of results, while keeping mathematics and signal processing theory to a minimum.

Key features:

Presents a new learning approach that will greatly improve studentsΓÇÖ ability to retain key concepts in electronics studies
Match the evolution of Computer Aided Design (CAD) which focuses increasingly on high-level design
Covers sub-functions as well as basic circuits and basic components
Provides real-world examples to inspire a thorough understanding of global issues, before going into the detail of components and devices
Discusses power conversion and management; an important area that is missing in other books on the subject
End-of-chapter problems and self-training sections support the reader in exploring systems and understanding them at increasing levels of complexity
 A supporting website (http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047074555X,descCd-relatedWebsites.html) presents the interactive student lab, ElvisLAB, where students can conduct virtual experiments on circuits together with PowerPoint slides for lecturers.
Inside this book you will find a complete explanation of electronics that can be applied across a range of disciplines including electrical engineering and physics. This comprehensive introduction will be of benefit to students studying electronics, as well as their lecturers and professors. Postgraduate engineers, those in vocational training, and design and application engineers will also find this book useful.
