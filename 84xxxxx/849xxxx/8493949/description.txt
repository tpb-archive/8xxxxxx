Steven Harris is one of the most out of the box thinkers when it comes to preparedness.  His no-nonsense approach to preparedness gets you ready and going in a few hours with everything from your local grocery store or Walmart.  Steve is all about ENABLING YOU.  So he gives you the information, tells you or shows you how to use the information which is now knowledge and then tells you where to get the items you need (again locally) so you are now enabled.  Unlike other survival books and videos he just does not 'tell you' and then leave you to fend for yourself.   You get the top to bottom package with what Steven Harris supplies for you.  In this torrent are subjects on Powering your House from Your Car with an Inverter in a disaster, Fuel and Fuel Storage, all of the stuff you NEVER KNEW and Steve blows the myths out of the water.  Want a home battery bank or one you can put in your pickup truck, Steve does this step by step.  Don't know what generator to get and how to hook it up, Steve again teaches you for free what others want to charge you hundreds for.  Plus with the class on Refrigerators and Freezers you'll have cold food for the duration of the disaster.  To our best count, over 450,000 people have accessed Steve's content and he gets emails daily with people sending photographs of what they have done and built and how they are prepared.  During Hurricane Sandy people were emailing photos and stories on their iphones to him.  There is almost 16 hours of content here for you to listen to.  Download it to your phone and you'll have a treasure of hands on DIY knowledge that will protect you and your family in times of trouble.  Be sure to read the READ ME files that Steve has included in the Torrents.  They'll get you started out the best.
