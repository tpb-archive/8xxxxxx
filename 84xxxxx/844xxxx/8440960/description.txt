The characters that inspired all of the heroes you know today are back! Before horn-head, before the crusader with a cape, before the guy who wears a skull on his chest, before the crawler of walls, there was...THE ORIGINALS! Based on a true historical event! In Feb, 1945, an object (or objects) appeared in the night sky above Los Angeles. The US anti-aircraft artillery opened fire, and over 1000 shells were fired at this object(s), but to no avail, nothing was brought down. What this object was remains a mystery to this day! Moonstone has unearthed the classified govt documents that show the real truth! The Phantom Detective, The Black Bat, Domino Lady, G-8, and Secret Agent X all teamed up to get rid of this threat!
