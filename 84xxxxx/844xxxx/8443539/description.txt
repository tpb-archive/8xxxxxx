General

Added a new playthrough called Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, unlocked for a character once they have completed the main story missions in True Vault Hunter Mode and reached level 50!

       In this mode, you will always start in Southern Shelf at Cleaning Up the Berg and may reset your playthrough progress as often as you like without losing any items, levels, or stats. All enemies are significantly more difficult in this playthrough, but the loot quality has increased accordingly. Rumor has it there is an entirely new rarity of loot out there for high-level players.

   Added new items to the Black Market:

       One additional ammo upgrade for each ammo type, at 50 Eridium each.

       Two more backpack storage space upgrades, at 50 and 100 Eridium respectively.

       Two more bank storage space upgrades, at 50 and 100 Eridium respectively.
