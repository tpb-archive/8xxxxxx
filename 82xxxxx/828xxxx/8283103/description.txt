Plot

Samir (Aasif Mandvi), a sous chef at an upscale New York restaurant, becomes frustrated with his boss (Dean Winters) and quits. His dreams of studying French cooking in France are shattered after his father becomes ill and he must take over his family's Indian restaurant, Tandoori Palace. Samir's knowledge of Indian cooking is limited until he meets the larger than life gourmet chef and taxi driver Akbar (Naseeruddin Shah). Samir's world is transformed via Akbar's cooking lessons, the magic of the masala and a beautiful co-worker, Carrie (Jess Weixler). While his mother (Madhur Jaffrey) tries to get him to settle down with a nice Indian girl and his father (Harish Patel) is convinced he will amount to nothing, Samir, Akbar, and a kitchen staff of eccentric characters concoct the most magical and mouth watering dishes in what soon becomes the best little Indian restaurant in New York.
