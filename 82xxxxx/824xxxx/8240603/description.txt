Is our online social life doomed to be laughed at by 13-year-olds? How can a web show host react to criticism? What do Trolls have in common with the Tusken Raiders from Star Wars? Why is it unlikely to see the '2girls1cup' video in the 'Selected especially for you' section of any website?

The Internet distorts our messages and our personas, it's important to know this and to counteract. In this 8000-word-long book you'll read about why there are so many assholes online, how they think and act, and why you should still see a human being in the most venomous hater.
