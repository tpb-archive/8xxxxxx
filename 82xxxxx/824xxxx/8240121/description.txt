 : From a helicopter high above the empty California desert, a man is sent    :
 : free-falling into the night.... In Chicago, a woman learns that an elite   :
 : team of ex--army investigators is being hunted down one by one.... And on  :
 : the streets of Portland, Jack Reacher--soldier, cop, hero--is pulled out of:
 : his wandering life by a code that few other people could understand. From  :
 : the first shocking scenes in Lee Child's explosive new novel, Jack Reacher :
 : is plunged like a knife into the heart of a conspiracy that is killing old :
 : friends...and is on its way to something even worse.                       :
 :                                                                            :
 : A decade postmilitary, Reacher has an ATM card and the clothes on his      :
 : back--no phone, no ties, and no address. But now a woman from his old unit :
 : has done the impossible. From Chicago, Frances Neagley finds Reacher, using:
 : a signal only the eight members of their elite team of army investigators  :
 : would know. She tells him a terrifying story--about the brutal death of a  :
 : man they both served with. Soon Reacher is reuniting with the survivors of :
 : his old team, scrambling to raise the living, bury the dead, and connect   :
 : the dots in a mystery that is growing darker by the day. The deeper they   :
 : dig, the more they don' t know: about two other comrades who have suddenly :
 : gone missing--and a trail that leads into the neon of Vegas and the        :
 : darkness of international terrorism.                                       :
 :                                                                            :
 : For now, Reacher can only react. To every sound. Every suspicion. Every    :
 : scent and every moment. Then Reacher will trust the people he once trusted :
 : with his life--and take this thing all the way to the end. Because in a    :
 : world of bad luck and trouble, when someone targets Jack Reacher and his   :
 : team, they'd better be ready for what comes right back at them...          :
