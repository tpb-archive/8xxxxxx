The main challenge in modern solvent extraction separation is that most techniques are mainly empirical, specific and particular for narrow fields of practice and require a large degree of experimentation. This concise and modern book provides a complete overview of both solvent extraction separation techniques and the novel and unified competitive complexation/solvation theory. This novel and unified technique presented in the book provides a key for a preliminary quantitative prediction of suitable extraction systems without experimentation, thus saving researchers time and resources.

    Analyzes and compares both classical and new competitive models and techniques
    Offers a novel and unified competitive complexation / solvation theory that permits researchers to standardize some parameters, which decreases the need for experimentation at R&D
    Presents examples of applications in multiple disciplines such as chemical, biochemical, radiochemical, pharmaceutical and analytical separation
    Written by an outstanding scientist who is prolific in the field of separation science
