ΓÇ£Holsters actually pre-date guns. Do you really think bands of wooly mammoth hunters carried spears and rocks in their hands? After all, they couldnΓÇÖt invent important things like fire and Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop Tarts with their hands all full of weapons.ΓÇ¥

LetΓÇÖs face it. Choosing the best way to carry a gun can be a daunting task. Whether youΓÇÖre new to guns or have been shooting since you were a wee tot, this book can help you understand concealed carry methods, how to carry a gun safely, and the relative pros and cons of over 120 specific holster models. WeΓÇÖll even teach you several ways to carry a gun in your underwear.

This book will help you make the right choice - saving you time and money - while offering a dose of humor while you learn.

Why do you need a book to choose and buy a holster? A few reasons really.

- At last count, there are 4,187,237 different holsters on the market. Well, that might be an estimate, but there are a lot. If you had a dollar for each of those holsters, you could almost cover the KardashiansΓÇÖ weekly clothing budget. So how do you choose the right holster with all those choices?

- Hardly any stores carry a wide selection of holsters. Sure they might carry a couple of brands, but will they have a brand right for you and the model specific to your gun? ItΓÇÖs kind of like trying to find just the right shade of Morning Tropical Ocean Breeze Sunrise interior house paint at your local convenience store. ItΓÇÖs just not likely to happen. And that leaves you the option of having to search and buy fromΓÇª the internet. And we all know that you canΓÇÖt always believe everything you read on the internet. Well, except Youtube comments. Those are almost always true and insightful.

- You canΓÇÖt really try holsters out before you buy. Especially those underwear holsters. Gun store sales staff tend to get a little cranky when you start shedding clothes next to the ammunition aisle.

- There are many different styles of concealed carry. Every day, innovative gun folks are inventing new ways to safely and discreetly carry guns. The variety of options is great, but how do you know which style of carry is right for you?

The editors at MyGunCulture.com have painstakingly documented all the holsters weΓÇÖve tried over the years and provided helpful commentary about pros and cons of different holster styles.

WeΓÇÖve listened to so many gun show huckster sales pitches that the late Billy Mays would be impressed. And the result? The Insanely Practical Guide to Gun Holsters.
