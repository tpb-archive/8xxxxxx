 : married life with her husband, John Gregory Dunne, and daughter, Quintana  :
 : Roo, this new book by Joan Didion examines her thoughts, fears, and doubts :
 : regarding having children, illness, and growing old.                       :

 : Blue Nights opens on July 26, 2010, as Didion thinks back to Quintana's    :
 : wedding in New York seven years before. Today would be her wedding         :
 : anniversary. This fact triggers vivid snapshots of Quintana's childhood--in:
 : Malibu, in Brentwood, at school in Holmby Hills. Reflecting on her daughter:
 : but also on her role as a parent, Didion asks the candid questions any     :
 : parent might about how she feels she failed either because cues were not   :
 : taken or perhaps displaced. "How could I have missed what was clearly there:
 : to be seen?" Finally, perhaps we all remain unknown to each other.         :
 : Seamlessly woven in are incidents Didion sees as underscoring her own age, :
 : something she finds hard to acknowledge, much less accept.                 :

 : Blue Nights--the long, light evening hours that signal the summer solstice,:
 : "the opposite of the dying of the brightness, but also its warning"--like  :
 : The Year of Magical Thinking before it, is an iconic book of incisive and  :
 : electric honesty, haunting and profoundly moving.                          :
