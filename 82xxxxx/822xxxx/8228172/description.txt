An extremely accessible narrative of the world's history

A book of extraordinary ambition, scholarship and accessibility, The New Penguin History of the World covers the history of our planet from our origins on the African savannah to the state of the world six years after September 11, 2001. Tracing the development of different civilizations through the ages, J. M. Roberts examines the periods of turbulence and change, the international shifts in order and power, and the conflicts, divisions, and advances that have shaped the way we live.

A truly global and comprehensive chronicle of human experience-of ordinary people, as well as of those in power-across all continents and conditions, The New Penguin History of the World brilliantly conveys the staggering diversity of human life and achievement.
