 : mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter    :
 : would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who:
 : raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter   :

 : Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest     :
 : woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't   :

 : Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will        :
 : nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all :
 : at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define:
 : their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.    :
