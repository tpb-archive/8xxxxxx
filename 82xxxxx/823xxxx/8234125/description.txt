Napoleon Hill (October 26, 1883 ΓÇô November 8, 1970) was an American author in the

 area of the new thought movement who was one of the earliest producers of the modern

 genre of personal-success literature. He is widely considered to be one of the great

 writers on success.His most famous work, Think and Grow Rich (1937), is one of

 the best-selling books of all time (at the time of Hill's death in 1970, Think and

 Grow Rich had sold 20 million copies).Hill's works examined the power of

 personal beliefs, and the role they play in personal success. He became an advisor 

 to President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1936. "What the mind of man can

 conceive and believe, it can achieve" is one of Hill's hallmark expressions.

 How achievement actually occurs, and a formula for it that puts success in reach of

 the average person, were the focal points of Hill's books.
