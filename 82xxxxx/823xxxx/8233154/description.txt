 : Geek Love is the story of the Binewskis, a carny family whose mater- and   :
 : paterfamilias set out--with the help of amphetamine, arsenic, and          :
 : radioisotopes--to breed their own exhibit of human oddities. There's Arturo:
 : the Aquaboy, who has flippers for limbs and a megalomaniac ambition worthy :
 : of Genghis Khan... Iphy and Elly, the lissome Siamese twins... albino      :
 : hunchback Oly, and the outwardly normal Chick, whose mysterious gifts make :
 : him the family's most precious--and dangerous--asset.                      :

 : As the Binewskis take their act across the backwaters of the U.S.,         :
 : inspiring fanatical devotion and murderous revulsion; as its members       :
 : conduct their own Machiavellian version of sibling rivalry, Geek Love      :
 : throws its sulfurous light on our notions of the freakish and the normal,  :
 : the beautiful and the ugly, the holy and the obscene. Family values will   :
 : never be the same.                                                         :
