Tia Ling is back in action for season 10. This is her 4th season on Ultimate Surrender and since her introduction to US she has come a long way. She is one of the smallest girls on our roster but she has been undefeated in the last two seasons ( records do not reflect the summer vengeance tournament bouts). She's quickly earning the nick name "The Giant Slayer". She's taking down women who out weight her by 40 or 50lbs at times. And she's trying to make today no different than all the other matches in the last 2 seasons. She takes on the rookie Audrey Hollander. Audrey is new to wrestling but she's a spunky red headed irish woman, fighting is in her blood and she's got 25 lbs on Tia. Audrey Thinks her size and spunk will get her the win, Tia thinks her experience and fetish for red heads will solidify her the win since she loves sticking her fingers deep into a red headed pussy. Audrey puts up good effort but its just not enough to break Tia's winning streak. Tia treats Audrey to a nice rookie welcoming by lifting her up and carrying her to the locker room to have her way with her.
