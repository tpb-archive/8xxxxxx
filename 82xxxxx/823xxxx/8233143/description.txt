 : A nuanced exploration of the part that religion plays in human life,       :
 : drawing on the insights of the past in order to build a faith that speaks  :
 : to the needs of our dangerously polarized age.                             :
 :                                                                            :
 : Moving from the Paleolithic age to the present, Karen Armstrong details the:
 : great lengths to which humankind has gone in order to experience a sacred  :
 : reality that it called by many names, such as God, Brahman, Nirvana, Allah,:
 : or Dao. Focusing especially on Christianity but including Judaism, Islam,  :
 : Buddhism, Hinduism, and Chinese spiritualities, Armstrong examines the     :
 : diminished impulse toward religion in our own time, when a significant     :
 : number of people either want nothing to do with God or question the        :
 : efficacy of faith. Why has God become unbelievable? Why is it that atheists:
 : and theists alike now think and speak about God in a way that veers so     :
 : profoundly from the thinking of our ancestors?                             :
 :                                                                            :
 : Answering these questions with the same depth of knowledge and profound    :
 : insight that have marked all her acclaimed books, Armstrong makes clear how:
 : the changing face of the world has necessarily changed the importance of   :
 : religion at both the societal and the individual level. Yet she cautions us:
 : that religion was never supposed to provide answers that lie within the    :
 : competence of human reason; that, she says, is the role of logos. The task :
 : of religion is "to help us live creatively, peacefully, and even joyously  :
 : with realities for which there are no easy explanations." She emphasizes,  :
 : too, that religion will not work automatically. It is, she says, a         :
 : practical discipline: its insights are derived not from abstract           :
 : speculation but from "dedicated intellectual endeavor" and a "compassionate:
 : lifestyle that enables us to break out of the prism of selfhood."          :
