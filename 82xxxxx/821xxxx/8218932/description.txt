 : James Gleick, the author of the best sellers Chaos and Genius, now brings  :
 : us a work just as astonishing and masterly: a revelatory chronicle and     :
 : meditation that shows how information has become the modern era's defining :
 : quality--the blood, the fuel, the vital principle of our world.            :
 :                                                                            :
 : The story of information begins in a time profoundly unlike our own, when  :
 : every thought and utterance vanishes as soon as it is born. From the       :
 : invention of scripts and alphabets to the long-misunderstood talking drums :
 : of Africa, Gleick tells the story of information technologies that changed :
 : the very nature of human consciousness. He provides portraits of the key   :
 : figures contributing to the inexorable development of our modern           :
 : understanding of information: Charles Babbage, the idiosyncratic inventor  :
 : of the first great mechanical computer; Ada Byron, the brilliant and doomed:
 : daughter of the poet, who became the first true programmer; pivotal figures:
 : like Samuel Morse and Alan Turing; and Claude Shannon, the creator of      :
 : information theory itself.                                                 :
 :                                                                            :
 : And then the information age arrives. Citizens of this world become experts:
 : willy-nilly: aficionados of bits and bytes. And we sometimes feel we are   :
 : drowning, swept by a deluge of signs and signals, news and images, blogs   :
 : and tweets. The Information is the story of how we got here and where we   :
 : are heading.                                                               :
