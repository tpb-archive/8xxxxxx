 :                                                                            :
 : In this epic, beautifully written masterwork, Pulitzer Prize--winning      :
 : author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of      :
 : American history: the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the:
 : South for northern and western cities, in search of a better life. From    :
 : 1915 to 1970, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of :
 : America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other :
 : peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained:
 : access to new data and official records, to write this definitive and      :
 : vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering :
 : our cities, our country, and ourselves.                                    :
 :                                                                            :
 : With stunning historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the    :
 : lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left       :
 : sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved :
 : quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he  :
 : ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, :
 : who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting  :
 : for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and :
 : Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career, the  :
 : personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful     :
 : medical career, which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often  :
 : threw exuberant parties.                                                   :
 :                                                                            :
 : Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting      :
 : cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that  :
 : grew into ghettos, as well as how they changed these cities with southern  :
 : food, faith, and culture and improved them with discipline, drive, and hard:
 : work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment, The Warmth of Other:
 : Suns is a bold, remarkable, and riveting work, a superb account of an      :
 : "unrecognized immigration" within our own land. Through the breadth of its :
 : narrative, the beauty of the writing, the depth of its research, and the   :
 : fullness of the people and lives portrayed herein, this book is destined to:
 : become a classic.                                                          :
