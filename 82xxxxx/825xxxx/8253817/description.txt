The Class 31 is a classic British workhorse just waiting to get to work in Train Simulator. 

At a time when steam traction looked dated, the Class 31 was designed to modernise freight and passenger haulage and was part of the new modern image sweeping across British Railways. Since its introduction in 1957, where it was originally intended for service in the Eastern Region, the Class 31 has become increasingly common in both Western and London Midland regions too. Whether it was passenger or freight duties the Class 31 was and is a very versatile locomotive and has survived in service for 53 years. The Class 31 for Train Simulator includes the Class 31 in BR Blue, Railfreight Grey and Civil Engineers Grey and Yellow Liveries, as well as appropriate freight wagons. 

Includes
- Class 31 in BR Blue, Railfreight Grey and Civil Engineers Grey and Yellow liveries
